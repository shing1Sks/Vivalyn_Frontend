## [3] supabase-auth — 2026-02-18

**Why:** The app needed user authentication to gate CTA actions (sign up, sign in) and prepare for user-specific features like a dashboard.

**What:** Added Supabase authentication supporting email/password, Google OAuth, and Microsoft Azure OAuth. Introduced React Router for multi-page routing, a global auth context, a login/signup page with animated form and OAuth buttons, and a simple protected dashboard. Header and CTA buttons now reflect auth state — showing "Sign in" when logged out and a user avatar dropdown when logged in.

**Changes:**
- `.env.example` — new; Supabase URL and anon key placeholders
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` — new; Supabase client singleton with env var validation
- `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` — new; React Context providing user/session state, email sign-in/sign-up, Google/Microsoft OAuth, sign-out, and `useAuth()` hook
- `src/pages/Landing.tsx` — new; extracted landing page content from App.tsx
- `src/pages/Auth.tsx` — new; login/signup page with tab toggle, Google & Microsoft OAuth buttons, email/password form, Framer Motion animations, subtle gradient background
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` — new; protected welcome page with user avatar, email display, and sign-out
- `src/App.tsx` — replaced section composition with React Router routes (`/`, `/auth`, `/dashboard`)
- `src/main.tsx` — wrapped app with `BrowserRouter` and `AuthProvider`
- `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` — "Sign in" button navigates to `/auth`; logged-in users see initial avatar with dropdown (email + sign out); nav links prepend `/` when off landing page
- `src/sections/Hero.tsx` — "Request pilot pricing" renamed to "Get started free", navigates to `/auth`
- `src/sections/CTASection.tsx` — primary button renamed to "Get started" with auth gate; secondary button remains "Book a demo"

## [2] pricing-section — 2026-02-16

**Why:** Landing page needed a pricing section to communicate plan options for both Indian and international users, with a free trial available on a demo-request basis.

**What:** Added a Pricing section with an India/International region toggle, 5 pricing tiers (Trial, Starter, Growth, Pro, Business), and animated card transitions. Pro plan is highlighted as "Most Popular". Trial tier uses a "Request Demo" CTA instead of direct signup.

**Changes:**
- `src/lib/constants.ts` — added `PricingPlan` interface, `PRICING_PLANS_IN` and `PRICING_PLANS_INTL` data arrays
- `src/sections/Pricing.tsx` — new; region toggle, 5-column pricing card grid with AnimatePresence transitions, per-session cost, bonus credits, and "Contact sales" footer
- `src/App.tsx` — added `<Pricing />` section between ReportPreview and SocialProof
